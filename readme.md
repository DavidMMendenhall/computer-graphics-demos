# Computer Graphics Demos
This repository contains various computer graphics demos using WebGL or WebGPU. Some of these demos were created under the request of a professor of a computer graphics course I worked for. The ones originally developed under this professor's request are:

- Frustum Culling 
- Raytracing
- Differed Rendering

I plan on adding other demos as well as time comes.

These demos make use of models from [The Stanford 3D Scanning Repository](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/)
