# Computer Graphics Demos
This repository contains various computer graphics demos using WebGL or WebGPU. Some of these demos were created under the request of a professor of a computer graphics course I worked for. The ones originally developed under this professor's request are:

- [Frustum Culling](./Frustum_Culling/index.html)
- [Raytracing Data Structures](./Ray_Tracing_Data_Structures/index.html)
- [Deferred Rendering](./Deferred_Rendering/index.html)

I plan on adding other demos as well as time comes.

These demos make use of models from [The Stanford 3D Scanning Repository](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/)
